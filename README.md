# Smoke-Detector
# Project Overview
This project performs a binary classification task using Logistic Regression to predict whether a smoke detector alarm should trigger based on sensor data. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, model fitting, and evaluation using various metrics. The goal is to build an interpretable and effective model for detecting smoke.
# Dataset 
The Smoke Detection Dataset contains various features that help in detecting smoke. Our goal is to build a logistic regression model to accurately classify smoke detection.
# Step-by-Step Approach
# Data Preprocessing 🔍
Missing Values: We'll detect and treat any missing values to ensure our dataset is clean.
Outliers: Identify and handle outliers to improve model accuracy.
Multicollinearity: Check for multicollinearity and eliminate redundant features.
Feature Elimination: Select the most important features for our model.
# Model Building and Evaluation 📈
We'll apply logistic regression using two powerful libraries: sklearn and statsmodels.
Compare the performance of models built using both libraries.
# Visualization 📉
Use visual tools to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
Plot the results to interpret the model's performance.
